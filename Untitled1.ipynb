            "- **Alignment**: For powerful models (especially large language models), we want their behavior to reflect human values and preferences.\n",

            "| **d. Reinforcement‑learning fine‑tuning** | The original model (now called the **policy**) is optimized to maximize the reward model’s predictions. | PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) is most common; other RL algorithms (A2C, REINFORCE) are also used. |\n",
